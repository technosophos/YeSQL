# Schemas that could be used for NoSQL

From [FriendFeed's Schema](http://bret.appspot.com/entry/how-friendfeed-uses-mysql):

>    CREATE TABLE entities (
        added_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        id BINARY(16) NOT NULL,
        updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
        body MEDIUMBLOB,
        UNIQUE KEY (id),
        KEY (updated)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB;

SQLite does not have rigid data types, and performs implicit type casting with some frequency. For this reason, working with it will be substantially different from other platforms.
